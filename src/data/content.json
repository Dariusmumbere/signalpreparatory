  "about_text": "<!--StartFragment-->\n\nSignal Preparatory is a school aiming at mentoring a coexisting generation with high levels of creativity, Innovations, world awareness and respect for Environmental Conservation in Children and young Adults.\n\nIï»¿t is located in one of the suburbs of Mpondwe Lhubiriha Town Council. Children are exposed to high levels of domestic violence, drug abuse, poor drainage and waste management, stereotypes, among others in this community. This horrible exposure sets fertile grounds for negative mindset hence self denial, low esteem, risks of diseases among others in children. As most institutions focus on youth, mothers and grownups, we thought it important to concentrate  on children and young adults through education.  \n\nThe truth is that every child deserves better. \n\nInspired by Proverbs 22:6, \"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it\", Signal got its humble beginning.\n\nWe use Child Art, Music, Sport and Drama to bring hope, empower and transform mindset of community children. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
