This leads to poor disposal and littering the school compound. Upon realizing this, a two months intensive sensitization about plastic waste management in our school and community. The 5 R's of waste management were emphasized .These included the; REUSE, RECYCLE, REDUCE, RETURN and REFUSE. After the intensive communication, the school Child Art worked with the Child waste Management team. They thought of recycling their bottle tops. Hence the idea of the Signal School Child Art/waste management mural. Parents and community well wishers participated in this mural.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",

The good news is that you can't change the beginning. But, you can start from where you are to change the end.\n\nAt Signal School, this gossiple is spread through MDD.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
